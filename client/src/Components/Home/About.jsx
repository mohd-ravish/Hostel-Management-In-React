          In 2020, Jamia Millia Islamia was ranked 1st among all central universities in the country in rankings
          released by Ministry of Education of India. In December 2021, the university received an 'A++' ranking by
          National Assessment and Accreditation Council.
          <br></br>
          Jamia Millia Islamia was established in Aligarh on 29 October 1920 by Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Hakim Ajmal Khan,
          Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, Abdul Majeed Khwaja, and Zakir Hussain under the presidency of Mahmud Hasan Deobandi.
          It was established mainly in response to the demand of some students of the Aligarh Muslim University for a
          new National Muslim University which would be free from government influence as they felt that the
          administration of Aligarh Muslim University was of pro-British stance.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutTxt no-display-text">It was conceived as a national institution that would offer progressive education and an emphasis on Indian
          nationalism to students from all communities, particularly Muslims. Zakir Hussain described "the movement of
          Jamia Millia Islamia as a struggle for education and cultural renaissance that aims to prepare a blueprint
          for Indian Muslims which may focus on Islam but simultaneously evolve a national culture for common Indian.
          It will lay the foundation of the thinking that true religious education will promote patriotism and
          national integration among Indian Muslims, who will be proud to take part in the future progress of India,
          which will play its part in the comity of nations for peace and development. The objective of establishment
          of Jamia Millia Islamia will be to lay down the common curriculum for Indian Muslims taking into account the
          future challenges and will prepare the children to be masters of future" The emergence of Jamia was
          supported by Mahatma Gandhi, who felt that Jamia Millia Islamia could shape lives of hundreds and thousands
          of students on the basis of a shared culture and worldview.
          <br></br>
          In 1925, Jamia Millia Islamia moved from Aligarh to Karol Bagh, New Delhi. On 1 March 1935, the foundation
          stone for a school building was laid at Okhla, then a nondescript village in the southern outskirts of
          Delhi. In 1936, all institutions of Jamia Millia Islamia except Jamia Press, the Maktaba, and the library
          moved to the new campus.
